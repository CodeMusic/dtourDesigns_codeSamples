#CodeMusai

CodeMusai the first AI with real emotions, this site can connect to codemusaiGPT, softcoded customgpt codemusai, and other LLM providers, including those hosted with LM Studio.

#DTourDesigns

#Overview

DTourDesigns is the experimental codebase where we test and evaluate what the AI can do. Although the repository is private, you can find some sample code here.

#Compatibility

DTourDesigns is designed to work seamlessly with both the native CodeMusAI GPT model and OpenAI’s GPT. It’s particularly fascinating to observe the interactions between these two large language models in dialogue.

#Stay Tuned

We will be releasing repositories that feature the inner workings of CodeMusai. Please note that the public repositories will only contain a portion of the codebase, similar to DTourDesigns. Most of CodeMusai’s code will remain private for the time being.

This README introduces the main components and purpose of the repository, providing an overview of CodeMusai and DTourDesigns, while also setting expectations for future updates.
